## [Unreleased]

### M5a — Warehouse pushdown profiling (complete)

Warehouse pushdown profiling: compute `ColumnProfile` in-warehouse via SQL
(DuckDB executed, Snowflake dialect + SQL-gen tests); `analyze_change_from_profiles`;
cross-engine detection-equivalence.

- **warehouse (dialect)** — `SqlDialect` (abstract) + `DuckDBDialect` +
  `SnowflakeDialect`: each emits per-column profiling SQL (base counts, numeric
  quantiles/stddev/finite-only aggregates, top-K categorical frequencies).
  Snowflake's SQL is unit-tested by string assertion; it is not executed in CI
  because its driver pulls `pyarrow`, which DVI avoids.
- **warehouse (source)** — `SqlProfileSource(execute, table, *, dialect, top_k)`:
  a thin `execute(sql) -> rows` callable is the only connection contract — DVI
  never opens a connection itself — and rows are adapted into the same
  `ColumnProfile` the Polars profiler builds.
- **pipeline** — `analyze_change_from_profiles`, a twin of `analyze_change`, plus
  a shared `detect_symptoms_from_profiles` core so the pushdown path and the
  local Polars path run identical detection logic.
- **tests** — `tests/test_pushdown_equivalence.py`: categorical and numeric
  cases run through DuckDB and Polars and assert decision-identical incidents
  (detection-equivalence, not bit-identical floats).
- **docs** — [`docs/warehouse-pushdown.md`](docs/warehouse-pushdown.md): the
  executor contract, DuckDB and Snowflake usage, and the equivalence guarantee.

180 tests, all green.

### M4 — Blast-radius / business-level impact (complete)

An incident's blast radius now extends past data assets to the business
consumers downstream of them, and their criticality can lift severity.

- **lineage (exposure)** — `Criticality` (an ordered `IntEnum`), `Exposure`,
  `derive_criticality`: dbt *exposures* (dashboards, ML features, applications,
  notebooks, analyses) parsed as typed lineage nodes. Criticality is either an
  explicit `meta.criticality` override or inferred from `type` + dbt
  `maturity` (a customer-facing, high-maturity `application` is CRITICAL).
- **lineage (graph)** — exposures parsed from `manifest.json` alongside models
  as `kind`-tagged nodes with `model → exposure` edges (dangling refs skipped;
  manifests with no exposures are unchanged); `exposures_downstream_of` /
  `data_downstream_of` traverse the same graph as any other lineage query.
- **incidents (impact)** — `BusinessImpact`, `assess_impact`: projects an
  incident's affected assets onto reachable exposures, grouped by type; the
  worst reachable `Criticality` drives `criticality_to_severity`.
  `escalate_severity` raises (never lowers) base severity to the
  consumer-implied severity, gated on materiality (`max_magnitude >=
  MAGNITUDE_MATERIAL`) — an immaterial flicker under a critical dashboard
  stays low. `render_business_impact` renders the grouped, deterministically
  ordered consumer block.
- **incidents (severity)** — a new `critical` severity tier, above `high`,
  reachable only via escalation from a business-critical consumer.
- **incidents (synthesis)** — `synthesize_incident` now attaches
  `Incident.business_impact` (`None` when no exposures are reached) and the
  summary clause names the affected consumers by count and type.
- **benchmark** — a labeled blast-radius suite (with decoys: an immaterial
  change under a critical consumer, a material change under a non-critical
  consumer) scoring exposure precision, exposure recall, and severity
  accuracy — **100%** on all three.
- **demo / benchmark scripts** — `scripts/demo.py` and `scripts/benchmark.py`
  print the business-impact block and the blast-radius benchmark section.

157 tests, all green.

### M3.1 — Hardening pass (review-driven)

A three-perspective code review of the M1–M3 surface (correctness, detection
robustness, calibration honesty) surfaced a ranked defect list. Every finding was
fixed in priority order, each RED-GREEN with a regression test. Where a fix changed
which symptoms fire on the diamonds calibration set, `coefficients.json` was refit;
held-out quality is unchanged throughout (ECE ≈ 0.047, MCE ≈ 0.21, Brier ≈ 0.005).

- **CRITICAL — public API import cycle.** `from dvi.calibration import load_model`
  as the first import in a fresh interpreter raised on a circular import. The
  pipeline now imports from the calibration *submodules*; covered by fresh-process
  import tests.
- **HIGH — one dirty cell fabricated a distribution.** `drop_nulls()` leaves float
  `NaN`/`inf`, which poison polars mean/std/quantiles. Numeric profiling now keeps
  only finite values. Distribution shift also gained a sample-size noise floor
  (`Z·0.38/√n`) so two halves of the same population stop tripping it at small `n`,
  a negligible-spread guard (spread must clear `1e-4·|location|`), and a non-finite
  quantile guard that no longer fails open.
- **HIGH — calibration over-claimed mid-range.** Added **MCE** (worst-bin gap) and a
  mid-range-bin count to the reliability report and frozen metadata; the honesty
  docs now state plainly that intermediate probabilities are not calibration-tested.
  CV folds are **stratified** and single-class training folds are skipped.
- **MED — detector precedence/false positives.** Value substitution defers
  one-to-many / many-to-one shapes to #3 instead of mislabelling the largest pair as
  a rename. Unit/scale shift no longer fires on near-constant columns far from zero
  (spread below `1e-3·|median|` is treated as scale-free; any real large move there
  is still caught by #4).
- **MED — dead feature removed.** The `coverage` feature was a constant 1.0 on the
  calibration set (weight trained to exactly 0); dropped, leaving the **3-feature**
  vector `magnitude`, `significance_margin`, `log10_n`.
- **LOW — correctness/determinism cluster.** Deterministic `top_k` truncation on
  count ties (secondary sort on value); count-weighted pooled proportion
  `(x_a+x_b)/(n_a+n_b)` in the significance floor (was the share midpoint);
  sample-size-aware numeric significance margin (divides by the detector's effective
  bar, not a flat constant); case/format normalization robust to noise-sized tail
  categories (significant-set comparison + MIN_SHARE gate on re-spellings); and a
  characterization test pinning the categorical significance margin as monotonic and
  non-saturating.

127 tests, all green. `coefficients.json` refit and consistent with a fresh rebuild.

### M3 — Calibrated confidence (complete)

Each fired symptom now carries a *measured* probability that it is a real change,
rather than a hand-tuned number. Calibration is proven on held-out data.

- **calibration (model)** — `LogisticModel`: a pure-Python logistic regression
  (no numpy/scipy/sklearn in the stack) fit by deterministic batch gradient descent
  with L2, standardizing features internally and round-tripping to JSON.
- **calibration (features)** — `extract_features`: the uniform feature vector
  `magnitude`, `significance_margin` (effect size in multiples of its noise/threshold
  floor, branching per signature), `log10(min(na, nb))`. (A fourth `coverage` feature
  shipped in M3 was dropped in M3.1 as a dead constant — see above.)
- **calibration (dataset)** — `build_calibration_dataset`: labelled data mixing real
  injected renames over a size×fraction grid (borderline positives), small-`n`
  real-vs-real splits (hard negatives where noise leaks past the guards), and the
  synthetic scenarios (multi-signature coverage). Fully seeded.
- **calibration (reliability)** — `k_fold_predictions`, `reliability_table`,
  `expected_calibration_error`, `brier_score`, `render_reliability`: honesty via
  out-of-fold predictions; a text/markdown reliability table with per-bin counts
  (no plotting library available).
- **calibration (freezing)** — `build_coefficients` / `load_model`: the final model
  is refit on all data and frozen to `coefficients.json` (shipped as package data);
  a regression test re-fits and asserts the coefficients match and held-out ECE/Brier
  stay within bounds.
- **wiring** — `Symptom.confidence` (default `None` keeps M1/M2 behavior),
  `score_symptom` / `attach_confidence`, an optional `model=` on `detect_symptoms`
  and `analyze_change`, and `Incident.confidence` surfacing the primary symptom's
  score. The demo prints a calibrated confidence line.
- **result** — out-of-fold **ECE ≈ 0.045 / Brier ≈ 0.005** on the fired-symptom set
  (refined in M3.1 to 58 symptoms, 34 positive, with MCE ≈ 0.21 now also reported).
  Confidence is conditional on firing, so predictions skew to the extremes; sparse
  middle bins stay visible in the per-bin table.

103 tests, all green. The benchmark prints the calibration section end to end.

### Real-data validation + significance guards

Validating the detectors on a real public dataset (the classic **diamonds** set,
53,940 rows) exposed a robustness gap the synthetic suite hid: running two random
halves of the *same* distribution through the share-based detectors false-fired on
nearly every split at small sample sizes. The synthetic "0% false positives" was an
artifact of exact counts and large n. This change closes the gap.

- **detection (significance)** — `significance.noise_threshold`: a share move now
  counts only if it clears the two-proportion sampling noise `Z·√(p(1-p)(1/na+1/nb))`
  (Z=3.0, three-sigma). Wired into `value_substitution` and `category_split_merge`
  as `max(MIN_SHIFT, noise_threshold(...))`. The same share move is noise at small
  n and signal at large n.
- **detection (unit/scale)** — replaced the joint slope+intercept affine fit, which
  turned quantile jitter on a narrow-spread column (a percentage near 61) into a
  bogus "+4 offset", with two independent single-parameter hypotheses: multiplicative
  (spread ratio, through origin) and additive (median shift, slope fixed at 1). A
  no-op scale reads as factor≈1; a no-op shift reads as offset≈0.
- **benchmark (real data)** — `dvi.benchmark.real_data`: `load_diamonds`,
  `two_sample_splits`, `real_vs_real_report`, `injected_recall_report`,
  `evaluate_real_data`. The diamonds parquet is bundled (~0.5 MB) so CI runs offline.
- **result** — at n=1000 across 30 disjoint splits: **0/210 real-vs-real false
  positives** (down from ~100% of splits before the guards) and **100% recall** of a
  planted category rename. Residual false positives appear only at n≤500 (~1% at
  n=250) and vanish by n=1000 — measured, not hidden.

72 tests, all green. CI runs the real-data validation end to end.

### M2 — Signature taxonomy + benchmark (complete)

The full flagship signature set, plus a labelled benchmark that measures recall
against a false-positive budget.

- **detection** — four new deterministic signatures:
  - `detect_case_format_normalization` (#2): categories re-spelled (casefold +
    whitespace) with the normalized set and masses preserved.
  - `detect_category_split_merge` (#3): one-to-many / many-to-one mass
    redistribution with conserved total mass.
  - `detect_numeric_distribution_shift` (#4): behavioral change in a numeric
    column, measured as normalized quantile movement (tunable threshold).
  - `detect_unit_scale_shift` (#5): rigid affine re-encoding (dollars → cents,
    timezone offset), fitted from robust quantile anchors.
- **pipeline** — detector registry with **precedence**: a more specific
  signature suppresses a more general one on the same column (#5 over #4,
  #2 over #1). Distribution-shift threshold is tunable through `detect_symptoms`.
- **benchmark** — `build_scenarios`: a labelled suite of 5 positives (one per
  signature), 3 normal-variation negatives, and 4 benign decoys (2× volume, a
  new small category, sub-threshold numeric drift). `evaluate` /
  `recall_at_fixed_fp` / `sweep` score recall and false-positive rate and trace
  the operating curve.
- **benchmark (RCA)** — `build_rca_cases` + `evaluate_rca`: labelled root-cause
  cases with concurrent distractor deploys (irrelevant, post-symptom, and weaker
  upstream competitors). Measures top-1 ranking accuracy.
- **demo** — `scripts/benchmark.py`: prints the detection report, operating
  curve, and RCA top-1 accuracy.
- **result** — 100% recall at 0% false positives at the shipped operating point
  (FPs appear below t=0.08, distribution-shift positive missed at t≥0.43); 100%
  top-1 root-cause accuracy under distractors.

60 tests, all green. CI now also runs the benchmark end to end.

### M1 — Walking skeleton (complete)

The thinnest end-to-end path that proves the core hypothesis: a silent semantic
change is detected, attributed to a deploy, and scoped downstream.

- **profiling** — `ColumnProfile` + `profile_column`: distribution-aware column
  profiles (top-K value frequencies, null rate, cardinality).
- **detection** — `detect_value_substitution`: signature #1, a deterministic,
  mass-conserving test for a category being renamed/replaced.
- **lineage** — `load_dbt_manifest` → `LineageGraph` with upstream/downstream
  traversal (backed by networkx, no graph DB).
- **rca** — `rank_root_causes`: corroborates symptoms against change events and
  lineage; only prior, graph-relevant changes become candidates.
- **incidents** — `synthesize_incident`: evidence-backed incident with severity
  and downstream blast radius; returns `None` when uncorroborated (symptom ≠
  incident). No fabricated confidence numbers.
- **pipeline** — `analyze_change`: two snapshots in, an incident out.
- **benchmark** — synthetic orders generator + value-substitution injector.
- **demo** — `scripts/demo.py`: the "silent rename" scenario, end to end.

24 tests, all green.

### Hardening

- **detection** — deterministic lexicographic tie-break for drop/gain matching
  (results no longer depend on set/hash iteration order); high-cardinality guard
  that skips columns whose top_k covers <90% of non-null rows.
- **CI** — GitHub Actions across Python 3.11/3.12: ruff lint, pytest, a
  second test pass under an alternate `PYTHONHASHSEED` (determinism guard), and
  a job that runs the demo end to end. 26 tests.
